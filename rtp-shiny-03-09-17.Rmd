# Reactivity 101

## Reactions

The `input$` list stores the current value of each input object under its name

![](img/reactions.png)

## Reactivity 101

Reactivity automatically occurs when an `input` value is used to render an `output` object

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define server function required to create the scatterplot --------
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Create the scatterplot object the plotOutput function is expecting
  output$scatterplot <- renderPlot(
   ggplot(data = movies, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, 
                                    color = input$z)) +
     geom_point(alpha = input$alpha)
  )
}
```

## Let’s build a simple movie browser app!

`movies.Rdata`: Data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes on random sample of 651 movies released in the US between 1970 and 2014

`movies.R`: Single file app for browsing movies

## Exercise

In the movies app:

- Add a new sliderInput defining the size of points (ranging from 0 to 5)
- Use this variable in the geom of the ggplot function as the size argument
- Run the app to ensure that point sizes react when you move the slider
- Compare your code / output with the person sitting next to / nearby you

## Solution

See `movies_02.R`

## Demo

Suppose you want the option to plot only certain types of movies as well as report how many such movies are plotted:

1. Add a UI element for the user to select which type(s) of movies they want to plot
2. Filter for chosen title type and save as a new (reactive) expression
3. Use new data frame (which is reactive) for plotting
4. Use new data frame (which is reactive) also for reporting number of observations

## Demo - 1

1. Add a UI element for the user to select which type(s) of movies they want to plot

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Select which types of movies to plot
checkboxGroupInput(inputId = "selected_type",
                   label = "Select movie type(s):",
                   choice = c("Documentary", "Feature Film", "TV Movie"),
                   selected = "Feature Film")
```

## Demo - 2

2. Filter for chosen title type and save the new data frame as a reactive expression

**before app:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

**server:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create a subset of data filtering for chosen title types
movies_subset <- reactive({
  movies %>%
    filter(title_type %in% input$selected_type)
})
```

*Note:* `reactive({})` creates a cached expression that knows it is out of date when input changes

## Demo - 3

Use new data frame (which is reactive) for plotting

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create the scatterplot object the plotOutput function is expecting
output$scatterplot <- renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = movies_subset(), aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y,
                                            color = input$z)) +
    geom_point(…) +
    …
})
```

*Note:* Cached - only re-run when inputs change

## Demo - 4 {.smaller}

Use new data frame (which is reactive) also for printing number of observations

**ui:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
mainPanel(
  ...
  # Print number of obs plotted
  textOutput(outputId = "n"),
  ...
  )
```

**server:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Print number of movies plotted
output$n <- renderText({
    counts <- movies_subset() %>%
      group_by(title_type) %>%
      summarise(count = n()) %>%
      select(count) %>%
      unlist()
    paste("There are", counts, input$selected_type, "movies in this dataset.")
})
```
