# Interactive visualizations with Shiny

Materials for the Interactive visualizations with Shiny RTP meetup. 

Slides can be viewed at [TBA].

Sign up at https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/events/237358623/.

While the materials for the workshop are designed for being used at the in-person 
workshop, all are welcomed to use and reuse them for learning and teaching.

While this workshop assumes no background in R, but willingness to learn a scripting
language, some background will be helpful for understanding Shiny syntax.

Focus of the workshop is creating interactive visualizations with R using Shiny, and not statistical data analysis.
